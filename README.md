# Secure VPN scripts
Script used to etablish a secure VPN connection and block all traffic not going via the VPN.
You can define some ports to bypass the VPN.

You can also add multiple VPN servers, so when the script cannot connect to one server, it will try the next one.

## Todo :
- knock knock for ports opening
- automatically switch betweens servers if we cannot connect to one
- auto detect local network
- test speed of different servers
